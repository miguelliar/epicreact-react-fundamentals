# Using JSX

## 📝 Your Notes

Elaborate on your learnings here in `src/exercise/03.md`

JSX is a friendly way of taking React.create element and display it as an HTML tag. 
As we can see below, JSX translates an HTML tag into a React.createElement (being 
more readable) and is the way it is usually used in React.

Here is a JSX example:
```jsx
const ui = <h1 id="greeting">Hey there</h1>

// ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ compiles to ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓

const ui = React.createElement('h1', {id: 'greeting', children: 'Hey there'})
```

The way it is translated is having a compiler taking the HTML code and internally
converts into JS code. Babel is an example of a compiler that does that (callback to
DLP). 

However, there are small differences when we compare attributes used in JSX from pure
React JS properties. All those can be found in [this page](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#differences-in-attributes). 
To illustrate it, here are some examples: 


| JSX                     | React                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| checked                 | defaultChecked               |
| className               | class                        |
| dangerouslySetInnerHTML | innerHTML                    |
| htmlFor                 | for                          |
| onChange                | (not comparable to onChange) |


Finally, in this exercise we will be using JSX directly. However, in production environments we
will usually precompile the JSX code and give directly a JS file. 

Some more marks:

(from optional 1)
- JSX makes use of the concept interpolation (insert something of different nature into something else)
- JSX allows using expressions and JS code which returns a value inside JSX tags. 
To do that we need to use ```{ }``` and any expression used inside will be evaluated.
- In practice, JSX interpolation does the following: 
```jsx
const greetings = "Hi"
const className = "container"

const ui = <h1 id="example" className={className}>{greetings.toLowerCase()}</h1>

// ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ compiles to ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓

const greetings = "Hi"
const className = "container"
const ui = React.createElement('h1', {id: 'example', className: className ,children: greetings.toLowerCase()})
```
- JSX tags are expressions and can never be statements
- Attributes inside the JSX tags are string literals (between ```" "```) or expressions (between ```{ }``` )
- JSX tags can contain as many children as needed or be closed


(from optional 2)
- Having already defined ```props``` object can be used directly in JSX with the ```...``` operator as a spread syntax.
- One example could be: 
```jsx
const props = {id: "example", className: "container", type:"button"}

const ui = <input {...props}></input>

// ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ compiles to ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓

const ui = React.createElement('input', props)

// ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ is equivalent to ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓

const ui = <input id="example" className="container" type="button"></input>
```
- It is also remarkable that, whenever we are using a JSX expression, and we add a prop
after or before the ```prop``` spreading, they will be combined in waterfall preference
  (last one inserted will be the one with more preference).
- An example could be: 
```jsx
const props = {id: "example", className: "container", type:"button"}

const ui = <input className="default" {...props} id="smashed-potatoes"></input>

// ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ is equivalent to ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓

const ui = <input className="container" type="button" id="smashed-potatoes"></input>
```
- Applying this can be beneficial when using default values.
## Background

JSX is more intuitive than the raw React API and is easier to understand when
reading the code. It's fairly simple HTML-like syntactic sugar on top of the raw
React APIs:

```jsx
const ui = <h1 id="greeting">Hey there</h1>

// ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ compiles to ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓

const ui = React.createElement('h1', {id: 'greeting', children: 'Hey there'})
```

Because JSX is not actually JavaScript, you have to convert it using something
called a code compiler. [Babel](https://babeljs.io) is one such tool.

🦉 Pro tip: If you'd like to see how JSX gets compiled to JavaScript,
[check out the online babel REPL here](https://babeljs.io/repl#?builtIns=App&code_lz=MYewdgzgLgBArgSxgXhgHgCYIG4D40QAOAhmLgBICmANtSGgPRGm7rNkDqIATtRo-3wMseAFBA&presets=react&prettier=true).

If you can train your brain to look at JSX and see the compiled version of that
code, you'll be MUCH more effective at reading and using it! I strongly
recommend you give this some intentional practice.

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/03.html)
- [Final](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.html)

Normally you'll compile all of your code at build-time before you ship your
application to the browser, but because Babel is written in JavaScript we can
actually run it _in_ the browser to compile our code on the fly and that's what
we'll do in this exercise.

So we'll include a script tag for Babel, then we'll update our own script tag to
tell Babel to compile it for us on the fly. When you're done, you should notice
the compiled version of the code appears in the `<head>` of the DOM (which you
can inspect using DevTools).

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 interpolate className and children

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.extra-1.html)

"Interpolation" is defined as "the insertion of something of a different nature
into something else."

Let's take template literals for example:

```javascript
const greeting = 'Sup'
const subject = 'World'
const message = `${greeting} ${subject}`
```

See if you can figure out how to extract the `className` (`"container"`) and
`children` (`"Hello World"`) to variables and interpolate them in the JSX.

```jsx
const className = 'container'
const children = 'Hello World'
const element = <div className="hmmm">how do I make this work?</div>
```

📜 The react docs for JSX are pretty good:
[https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

Here are a few sections of particular interest for this extra credit:

- [https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx)
- [https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#specifying-attributes-with-jsx](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#specifying-attributes-with-jsx)

### 2. 💯 spread props

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.extra-2.html)

What if I have an object of props that I want applied to the `div` like this:

```jsx
const children = 'Hello World'
const className = 'container'
const props = {children, className}
const element = <div /> // how do I apply props to this div?
```

If we were doing raw React APIs it would be:

```jsx
const element = React.createElement('div', props)
```

Or, it could be written like this:

```jsx
const element = React.createElement('div', {...props})
```

See if you can figure out how to make that work with JSX.
